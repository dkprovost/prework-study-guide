# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation for this repository was to create a a convenient study guide for the information learned
in the Prework for my Coding Bootcamp.
- I built this project as a digital tool to have essential notes online, accessible anywhere. 
- This solves the problem of searching through several pages of a notebook to find information. It also solves the problem of possible loss of notes due to damage or misplacement when working with standard paper.
- I learned a great deal on this project. Not only did I learn about the foundations of web development including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript; I also learned how to become more adept and comfortable with the command line interface, GitHub repository, and, most importantly, how much perseverance I can muster when facing challenges in a new project like this.

## Usage

This guide can be used by quickly identifying each boxed section as one of the core components of the prework: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each box contains notes to act as a reference guide when working with each component. By opening up the DevTools console, I can see JavaScript running and provide a random section I can study at that time from the list of topics covered in the Prework.
